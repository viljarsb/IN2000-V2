    * There are several potential issues with this test.
    * 1. If the screen adjusts differently than placing the GMaps infobox in the middle, this test will fail.
    *   - This can happen if GMaps updates their infoview functionality, and we update the Gradle implementation as well.
    * 2. (This is not tested) If there is a beach at the near end of the map, the restrictions placed on the movement of the app
    *    may prevent the application from placing the info window to the middle of the screen.
    *
    * As mentioned further below, the code for clicking on a marker, and for adjusting the screen when clicking on infowindow is
    * copied from links given below.
